## Features Overview

- Native app (written in C++ with Qt).
- Fast with a low memory footprint.
- Fully open source and cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows).
- Completely private - tracks nothing.
- Beautiful and sleek looking, yet still powerful.
- Folders and tags. Organize your ideas hierarchically using nested folders and universally using tags.
- Markdown Support. Format text without lifting your hands from the keyboard.
- Different themes. Switch between Light, Dark, and Sepia.
- Feed View. Select multiple notes to see them all one after another in the editor.
- Always runs in the background. Use the hotkey "Windows" + 'N' to summon Notes. "control" + "N" for macOS.
- Keyboard shortcuts. Meant to have the option to be used solely with a keyboard (but more work needs to be done there).
- What feature will you contribute?

## Support the project

If you use Notes daily, consider donating money so I can pay programmers to develop new features and fix bugs. I partner with [Github Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/nuttyartist) and [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/rubymamis) to receive contributions. You can also put a bounty on specific issues using Bountysource. I currently make a living from ads on the website, but I'd like to stop with that.
