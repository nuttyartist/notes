## Features Overview

- Native app (written in C++ with Qt).
- Turn your Markdown tasks into a beautiful Kanban board.
- Fast and beautiful.
- Fully open source and cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows).
- Completely private - tracks nothing.
- Folders and tags. Organize your ideas hierarchically using nested folders and universally using tags.
- Markdown Support. Format text without lifting your hands from the keyboard.
- Different themes. Switch between Light, Dark, and Sepia.
- Feed View. Select multiple notes to see them all one after another in the editor.
- Always runs in the background. Use the hotkey <kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>N</kbd> to summon Notes. <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>N</kbd> for macOS.
- Keyboard shortcuts. Meant to have the option to be used solely with a keyboard (but more work needs to be done on that).
- What feature will you contribute?

## Keyboard shortcuts

All keyboard shortcuts are [documented here](docs/keyboard_shortcuts.md).

## Pro Version

You can also donate money either through [Github Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/nuttyartist), or [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/rubymamis), or put a bounty on specific issues using Bountysource. If you wish, you can access all Pro features at no cost by building the app from source. See "Building from source" below.
